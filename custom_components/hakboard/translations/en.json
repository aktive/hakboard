API details are located at `Kanboard UI \\ Settings \\ API`\n\n**⚠️ Instance Key (Important):** The Instance Key is a short, mandatory, unique identifier (e.g. `hl`). It is the namespace for all HAKboard entity IDs, ensuring uniqueness and preventing collisions.\n\n**Example:** setting the Instance Key to `hl` to denote your `Homelab` instance will result in the following created entity IDs: `sensor.hakboard_hl_xxx`\n\n**ℹ️ NOTE:** HAKboard is a community project and is not affiliated with Kanboard.",
